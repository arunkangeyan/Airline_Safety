# Airline_Safety
The dataset that I am using is linked here (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv), titled *“Airline Safety”*,
which contains information of safety records for major commercial airlines over the past 30 years, as based on the Aviation Safety Network's database. The data of the 30-year period is broke down into two halves: first from 1985 to 1999, and then from 2000 to 2014. To check weather there is a correlation in crash rates from one half of the data set to the other. If correlation is identified, that will imply that crash risk is persistent — predictable to some extent based on the airline.

The author Nate Silver extracted the data from Aviation Safety Network’s database.He collected the data for 56 airlines that were in the global top 100 as of December 2012 and which have operated continuously since Jan. 1, 1985. The data contains Information such as available seat kilometers flown every week, Total number of incidents, Total number of fatal accidents and Total number of fatalities.

He defines crashes in three ways:
First, based on the rate of incidents as listed in the database, whether or not they resulted in a fatality.
Next, based on the rate of fatal accidents.
Finally, by the rate of fatalities among passengers and crew on the airline.
